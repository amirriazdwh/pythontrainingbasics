# Summary of Git and GitHub Concepts Discussed

## **1. Git Local Repository & `.git/` Folder**
- When you **clone** a repository, Git copies all files and creates a `.git/` folder.
- `.git/` contains metadata, commit history, blobs, trees, and references.
- If you **delete `.git/`**, the project loses all version history.

## **2. Blobs, Trees, and Commits (Git’s Internal Storage)**
### **Blobs**
- Blobs (**Binary Large Objects**) store **file contents**.
- Each file version is saved as a new **blob**, even for small changes.
- Blobs do **not track changes**, only full file contents.

### **Trees**
- A **tree** is a snapshot of the project at a commit.
- It contains **references to blobs** and subdirectories.
- Trees organize the structure of files but do not store their content.

### **Commits**
- A **commit is a snapshot** that records a tree.
- Each commit **links to a parent commit**, forming a chain.
- Commits store:
  - A reference to the **tree** (file structure at that moment).
  - A reference to the **previous commit** (history tracking).
  - Metadata (author, date, message).

## **3. How `git add` and `git commit` Work**
| Git Command | Action |
|-------------|---------|
| `git add .` | Creates **new blobs** for modified files and updates the **tree**. |
| `git commit -m "Message"` | Creates a **new commit** that references the updated tree and **links to the previous commit**. |

- **Commits don’t store diffs; they store full snapshots.**
- **Git compares trees to detect changes (`git diff`).**

## **4. How Git Detects Changes**
1. Git calculates **SHA-1 hashes** for each file.
2. It compares the current file’s hash to the **staged version**.
3. If hashes differ, Git marks the file as **modified** (`git status`).

## **5. Commit Linking: Reference vs. Time**
✅ **Commits are linked by reference (SHA-1), NOT by time.**  
- Each commit points to a **parent commit** (except the first one).
- This **forms a chain of commits** that Git follows.
- **Timestamps are recorded but do not determine commit order.**

### **Viewing Commit References**
```sh
git log --pretty=oneline
```
- This command shows commit hashes and messages.
- Commits are ordered based on **references, not time**.

## **6. Viewing Git Snapshots and Changes**
| Git Command | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `git ls-tree -r HEAD` | View the blobs (files) in the latest commit. |
| `git cat-file -p <blob_hash>` | See the content of a specific blob. |
| `git log --oneline --graph` | View commit history as a tree. |
| `git diff HEAD~1` | Compare the last two commits. |

## **7. How GitHub Stores Repositories**
- **GitHub is a remote Git hosting service**.
- It follows the same snapshot model:
  - Each push updates commits (snapshots).
  - GitHub does **not store diffs**—it references commits.
- `.git/` on GitHub is managed by the platform.

## **8. Handling Unnecessary Files**
- Some files (e.g., `.idea/`, `.mypy_cache/`) should **not be tracked**.
- Use `.gitignore` to prevent Git from adding them.

```sh
echo ".idea/" >> .gitignore
git rm -r --cached .idea/
git commit -m "Ignored .idea folder"
```

## **9. Understanding the Commit Log Output**
### Example Log Entry:
```
commit b63a3e051192acb95104530117b7de1bc2005b55 (HEAD -> master, github/master)
Author: amirriazdwh <amir.riaz.dwh@gmail.com>
Date:   2025-02-09 14:17:10 +0400

    removing pycharm dependencies
```

| Part | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Commit Hash** | `b63a3e0...` → Unique ID for the commit. |
| **HEAD -> master** | Your local `master` branch points to this commit. |
| **github/master** | This commit matches the remote branch on GitHub. |
| **Author** | `amirriazdwh <amir.riaz.dwh@gmail.com>` created the commit. |
| **Date** | `2025-02-09 14:17:10 +0400` (UTC+4). |
| **Message** | "removing pycharm dependencies" explains the purpose of the commit. |

### **Confirming if the Commit Was Pushed**
1️⃣ **Check Local vs Remote Sync Status**
```sh
git status
```
**Expected output:**
```
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'github/master'.
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```
💡 **If this message appears, your local and remote repositories are synchronized.**

2️⃣ **Check Remote Branches**
```sh
git branch -vv
```

3️⃣ **View Commit History with Remote Tracking**
```sh
git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all
```

## **10. Summary of Key Takeaways**
✅ **Git tracks full file snapshots, not just diffs.**  
✅ **Blobs store file content, trees store structure, commits track history.**  
✅ **Commits are linked by reference (SHA-1), not timestamps.**  
✅ **GitHub follows the same snapshot storage system.**  
✅ **`git add` stages new blobs; `git commit` links commits in a chain.**  
✅ **Changes are detected by hashing file content.**
