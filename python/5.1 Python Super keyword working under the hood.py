The Method Resolution Order (MRO) indeed forms a tree-like structure, but it’s more accurately described as a 
linearization of the inheritance hierarchy. This linearization determines the order in which classes are looked up for methods.

Visualizing MRO
Let’s visualize the MRO for your example:

Python

class A:
    def method(self):
        print("Method in A")

class B(A):
    def method(self):
        print("Method in B")
        super().method()

class C(A):
    def method(self):
        print("Method in C")
        super().method()

class D(B, C):
    def method(self):
        print("Method in D")
        super().method()
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
The MRO for class D is [D, B, C, A, object]. This means that when you call super() in D, it looks up the next class in this order.

Tree Structure
While the MRO is a linear sequence, the inheritance hierarchy can be visualized as a tree:

    A
   / \
  B   C
   \ /
    D

How super Works
Starting Point: When you call super() in D, it starts at D and looks up the next class in the MRO, which is B.
Next in Line: super() in B then looks up the next class in the MRO, which is C.
Continuing Up: super() in C looks up the next class in the MRO, which is A.
Example Execution
Python

d = D()
d.method()
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
This will output:

Method in D
Method in B
Method in C
Method in A

Summary
MRO: The MRO is a linear sequence that determines the order in which classes are looked up for methods.
Tree Structure: The inheritance hierarchy can be visualized as a tree, but the MRO linearizes this structure.
super: When super() is called, it looks up the next class in the MRO, ensuring that methods are called in the correct order.
This mechanism ensures that the correct methods are called, respecting the inheritance hierarchy and avoiding issues like the 
diamond problem in multiple inheritance scenarios.
